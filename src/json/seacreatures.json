But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?",

A \"living fossil,\" the horseshoe crab has been around since before the dinosaurs. With that tank-like shell, I suppose it WOULD be the one to survive. But here's what truly rattles me to my beak... During breeding season, horseshoe crabs crawl up on the beach and make nests together in the hundreds. HUNDREDS OF HORSESHOE CRABS! And with that I can say no more.",
